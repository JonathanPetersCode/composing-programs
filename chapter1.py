The areas of globally distributed systems, artificial intelligence, robotics, graphics, security, scientific computing, computer architecture, and dozens of emerging sub-fields all expand with new techniques and discoveries every year.

These fundamental ideas have long been taught using the classic textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs(SICP) by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman.
